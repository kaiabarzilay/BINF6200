# BINF6200 Assignment 1
These are three codes, which take either a hardcoded sequence or an input and produce properties such as weight or length.

## Description:

The first code is protein_to_daltons.py, which takes a hardcoded amino acid sequence and calculated the length of the sequence and the weight in kilodaltons. The second code is input_to_amino_acids.py, which takes an input from the user of a DNA sequence name and its length and prints the name and length. This code then checks if the sequence length is divisible by 3, and if it is, the length of the protein sequence and the average weight are calculated and printed. If this sequence length is not divisible by 3, an error message is printed. The third code is input_to_protocol.py, which takes an input of volumes of solution, NaCl and MgC12, and returns instructions on what solutions to add. All codes have been checked for proper execution and have past linting. 

## Executing Programs in command line:

```
$ python3 protein_to_daltons.py
```
```
$ python3 input_to_amino_acids.py
```
```
$ python3 input_to_protocol.py
```
